        <div class="boxed">Rosaria, a sister in Mondstadt's Church of Favonius.
            A sister of the church, though you wouldn't know it if it weren't for her attire. An unusual woman with
            sharp,
            piercing
            words and a cold manner.
            Her movements are unpredictable. She often leaves without notifying anyone. She acts with some kind of
            purpose,
            but
            others don't seem to know exactly what she stands for...

        <p>Rosaria is a somewhat intimidating woman who has a rather unorthodox idea of piety. Kaeya describes her as
            someone
            who is "honest with herself". She dislikes topics that bore her and having to work overtime. Fischl
            overheard her
            cursing out someone in Barbatos' name and takes it as a sign of Rosaria's piety, an interpretation Oz
            doubts.

            Despite her position in the church, Rosaria is seen as extremely lazy by her fellow sisters, as she is
            always
            guaranteed to skip all church activities when possible, and is the first one to leave when she is forced to
            attend.<sup class="reference"><a
                href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rosaria#cite_note-rosaria_story-7">[7]</a></sup> She is
            extremely negligent to the point that she is infamous by her fellow sisters for her
            truancy, but
            nonetheless was promoted without much trouble.</p>
        <p>
            Secretly, she acts as a purveyor of justice for the Church, investigating potential threats to Mondstadt and
            eliminating them if necessary. She is particularly skilled in killing, having been taught by her former
            "family", a group of bandits before they had been wiped out by the Knights of Favonius.<sup class="reference"><a
                href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rosaria#cite_note-rosaria_story-7">[7]</a></sup> Due to being
            offered a chance for redemption by Varka, Rosaria sees herself differently to the people of Mondstadt,<sup class="reference"><a
                href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rosaria#cite_note-rosaria_story-7">[7]</a></sup>
            and is indebted to them for their unselfish warmth and goodwill.<sup class="reference"><a
                href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Rosaria#cite_note-rosaria_story-8">[8]</a></sup>  
            Like Fischl, her intuition is very keen, as she correctly suspects that Albedo is hiding something.
            Likewise, she is also able to see through the mysterious Kaeya with ease after getting him drunk. She enjoys
            alcohol and alcohol-drenched foods, but is unusually tolerant towards it, claiming that she has not gotten
            drunk yet.

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Rosaria is a tall adult female with ghostly pale grey skin. She has choppy wine-colored hair cut short in the
            back, with some strands of her bangs colored a darker red. Rosaria has pale magenta eyes with cat-like light
            pink irises, and noticeable bags under her eyes. She almost always has a serious expression on her face.

            Rosaria wears a form-fitting nuns habit consisting of a long white and black coif with red lining, a white
            sleeveless turtleneck top, long white gloves, and a long black and red slit skirt that partially reveals her
            right leg and completely reveals her left. She wears black belts around her left thigh, along with black
            fishnet tights and silver high-heels.

            Rosaria's outfit is adorned with multiple silver and white gold accessories embedded with red gems;
            including a silver tiara on top of her coif, a silver pendant on her white top, a white gold brooch on her
            left shoulder and left hip, multiple silver claw rings on her fingers and a small silver censer tied to her
            right wrist with a long piece of black cloth. Her Cryo vision hangs off of her waist on her lower back. Her
            outfit, Executor's Thorns, is described as a heavily modified Church of Favonius uniform made by Rosaria
            herself.</p>
